# Proj4RDF - Representing spatial reference systems in RDF

This repository contains the following data:
* An ontology draft for representing spatial reference systems in RDF
* A converted dataset of spatial reference systems present in the pyproj4 library in RDF
* A converted set of more than 4000 interstellar geoids for the use for spatial reference systems in RDF
* An extraction script from pyproj definitions to RDf
* Initial SHACL rules for the validation of spatial reference systems in RDF
* Testdata showing how different types of spatial objects can be modeled using the new ontology model
* Extension of the Apache Jena library for the new ontology model

## GeoSPARQL SRS ontology draft

The GeoSPARQL SRS ontology draft contains classes for the following components of a spatial reference system:
